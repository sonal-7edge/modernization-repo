    Summary: # Code Modernization Summary

## Technical Narrative

The ContosoUniversity project has been modernized from .NET 6.0 to .NET 8.0, with Entity Framework Core packages updated across multiple versions. The csproj file now targets net8.0 and includes explicit exclusion of the Migrations folder from compilation. Across the Razor Pages, view data handling has been standardized by migrating from `ViewData` dictionary access to `ViewBag` dynamic properties, and Razor syntax has been streamlined by removing the `@` symbol prefix from `Model` property access in tag helpers and introducing local variables to cache collection references before enumeration.

## Key Technical Changes

**Framework and Package Updates:**
- Target framework upgraded from net6.0 to net8.0
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore updated from 6.0.2 to 8.0.22
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer updated from 6.0.2 to 9.0.9
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools updated from 6.0.2 to 8.0.20
- Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design updated from 6.0.2 to 8.0.7

**Project Structure Changes:**
- Added explicit exclusion of Migrations folder from Compile, Content, EmbeddedResource, and None item groups
- Added UTF-8 XML encoding declaration to csproj file

**View Rendering Modifications:**
- Replaced `ViewData["Title"]` dictionary syntax with `ViewBag.Title` dynamic property access across 18 Razor pages
- Changed `ViewData["Title"]` to `ViewContext.ViewData["Title"]` in Details.cshtml and Edit.cshtml for Instructors
- Updated partial rendering from `@{await Html.RenderPartialAsync()}` to `@await Html.PartialAsync()` in Create pages
- Removed `@` prefix from `Model` property references in asp-items attributes (e.g., `@Model.DepartmentNameSL` to `Model.DepartmentNameSL`)

**Code Optimization:**
- Introduced local variable caching for collection properties before foreach loops in Instructors/Index.cshtml (instructors, courses, enrollments)
- Changed Privacy.cshtml to use local variable `pageTitle` instead of ViewData
- Removed unused model declarations and ViewData assignments in multiple pages

**Code Cleanup:**
- Standardized line endings and removed trailing whitespace
- Removed empty ViewData blocks where Title was not set
- Consolidated Razor code block formatting

SOLUTION SUMMARY:
  # Code Modernization Summary

## Framework Migration
- Target framework migrated from .NET 6.0 to .NET 8.0
- Entity Framework Core packages updated: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore (6.0.2 → 8.0.22), Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (6.0.2 → 9.0.9), Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (6.0.2 → 8.0.20)
- Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design updated from 6.0.2 to 8.0.7
- UTF-8 XML encoding declaration added to csproj file
- Migrations folder explicitly excluded from Compile, Content, EmbeddedResource, and None item groups

## Razor Pages Refactoring
- View data access pattern changed from `ViewData["Title"]` dictionary syntax to `ViewBag.Title` dynamic property access across 18 pages
- Instructors Details.cshtml and Edit.cshtml updated to use `ViewContext.ViewData["Title"]`
- Partial rendering syntax changed from `@{await Html.RenderPartialAsync()}` to `@await Html.PartialAsync()` in Create pages
- Tag helper syntax simplified by removing `@` prefix from Model property references in asp-items attributes
- Privacy.cshtml refactored to use local variable `pageTitle` instead of ViewData

## Performance Optimizations
- Collection properties cached in local variables before foreach enumeration in Instructors/Index.cshtml (instructors, courses, enrollments)

## Code Cleanup
- Unused model declarations and ViewData assignments removed
- Empty ViewData blocks removed where Title was not set
- Razor code block formatting consolidated
- Line endings standardized and trailing whitespace removed
